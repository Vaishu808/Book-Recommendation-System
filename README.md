# Book-Recommendation-System
### Project Description

This project is a Book Recommendation System built using Collaborative Filtering techniques. It recommends books to users based on similarities in user ratings and reading preferences. The goal is to help users discover books they are most likely to enjoy by analyzing past interactions.

---------------------------
### Objectives

- Recommend books based on user interests

- Analyze user–book rating patterns

- Build a personalized recommendation system using machine learning concepts

---------------------------
### Methodology

- Collaborative Filtering

- Cosine Similarity for measuring similarity between books

- Data filtering to remove inactive users and less-rated books

---------------------------
### Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook

---------------------------
### Dataset Information

- The dataset includes:

- Book details (title, author, etc.)

- User information

- User ratings for books

- To improve recommendation accuracy, only popular books and active users are considered.

---------------------------
### Project Workflow

- Load and preprocess the dataset

- Clean data by removing sparse entries

- Create a user–book interaction matrix

- Apply cosine similarity to find similar books

- Generate top book recommendations

---------------------------
### Results

- Successfully recommends books based on similarity scores

- Identifies popular and highly rated books

- Provides meaningful insights through visual analysis

---------------------------
### Conclusion

The Book Recommendation System demonstrates the effective use of collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations. It shows how user behavior and rating patterns can be leveraged to build intelligent recommendation engines.
